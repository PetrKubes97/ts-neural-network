### How to run

After cloning the repository, run:
- ``npm install``
- ``npm run build``
- Then, you can simply open the ``index.html`` file in your browser

### How to contribute
No rules, I'll accept any improvements. 

A few things that would be nice but I'm too lazy to implement:
- Ability to edit weights --> maybe hover over weight could show slider just like with inputs
- Graph of cost over iterations
